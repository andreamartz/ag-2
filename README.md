### Design - Accessibility Considerations

Although not directly addressed in our wireframe and prototype, we know that every site should meet accessibility standards.  While we are not experts in accessibility and have no formal training in accessibility practices or standards, we have incorporated everything we know about accessibility into the building of this site.

#### Design - Accessibility - Images

There are no background images on this site.  As ours is a site designed to sell clothing, we believe that all images are part of the core content of the site.  For that reason, background images - which do not provide information to search engines and do not offer alt text to describe the image - were avoided.

## Things We've Learned

## Future Improvements

The time allotted for this project was tight for us, because we were learning to code while we were building this site.  We were also working on other projects simultaneously and taking in a large amount of new information as students in the Moms Can Code School.

As a result, there are some features we did not have time to build before the due date.  There are also some bugs we did not fix yet.  We hope to have time after the MCCS program is over to improve the site in these ways.  As we think of improvements to make, we've been logging them in the Issues tab.
